    <h2>About Ayfal Henna</h2>
    <p>At Ayfal Henna, we believe that henna is more than just a design—it's a story, a celebration, and a cultural expression woven into delicate lines and curves. Rooted in rich South Asian and Middle Eastern traditions, our work brings together the elegance of ancient patterns with a modern flair, creating timeless beauty for every occasion.

        Whether you're preparing for your wedding day, a festive gathering, or simply wish to adorn your hands with something meaningful and artistic, our designs are tailored to reflect your personal style. Every stroke is drawn with natural, high-quality henna to ensure not only a stunning result, but also a safe and comfortable experience for your skin.

        Founded with a passion for tradition and creativity, Ayfal Henna is proud to serve a diverse community of clients in Calgary and beyond. We specialize in bridal henna, party designs, children's henna, and custom requests for any event. Our goal is simple — to make you feel celebrated, confident, and beautifully unique.

        Let us bring beauty to your hands and joy to your heart, one design at a time.
